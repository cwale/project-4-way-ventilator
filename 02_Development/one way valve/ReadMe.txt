One_way_valve V1


Parts list

-Part A
-Part B
-Silicon Disc

The silicon disk can have a thickness varying between 1 and 2 mm and an ideal diameter between 15 and 13.5. ( I use a peace of cake cooking molde made of silicon ) 

Simply place the disc centered inside part B and spot it with part A.
The assembly of part A must only be done by applying force without glue.

TESTING:
Test ability as a one way valve and also do cycle testing to ensure it can withstand the 1000cycles/hour
